London weather app is a small weather application designed to help those in need to know the weather
of the following day between 09:00-12:00 to plan their day ahead. It uses the api services of
openweathermap.org to get the weather data of tomorrow and displays them on a simple minimalistic website.
Although the info is not neccessarily true, since we chose to convert the ID number of the weather to the nearest hundread,
thereby changing the description of the weather & icon (don't ask me why), you can still rely on the temperature, which remains
unchanged. Have a nice day London folks!
